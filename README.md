# medeaire-back
Web Scrapper built with NodeJS using CheerioJS in order to get the data from website [elcolombiano.com](https://www.elcolombiano.com/contaminacion-en-medellin/index.html) and serve it to the [FE of this app](https://github.com/duverj/medeaire).

**To test:**
- npm install
- node server.js
- navigate to http://localhost:4000

Then open the FE app in your browser to see the data retrieved from the source.
